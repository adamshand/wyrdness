The Wyrdoscope uses two live quantum-based random event generators. It analyses correlations between their outputs. Under normal conditions,
the streams should be uncorrelated. But during meaningful, emotionally engaged, or symbolically charged moments, sudden synchrony can appear.

The Wyrd Light, by contrast, uses stored random data—sequences that were recorded long ago and should never change. Yet even this pre-recorded
data can show patterns of coherence in synchrony with user experience—if the data has not yet been “observed,” and if the system is closed and
meaningful at the time of analysis.

This apparent paradox has been demonstrated in multiple studies in parapsychology and is explained within MPI as a kind of non-causal
entanglement that forms between system elements (person, device, data) when they become part of a shared, meaningful structure.
