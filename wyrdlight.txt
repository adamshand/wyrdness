Based on detecting human influence on random data streams (through a non-physical field of consciousness), we have created the Wyrd Light to interactively reflect or ‘showcase’ this effect. 

When random data samples within the Light’s technical core appear random, the Wyrd Light will not shine brightly. But as soon as your influence becomes statistically significant, it will begin to light up–without you touching it or otherwise interacting with it in any way. The stronger the effect, the brighter the light shines–and the lighting patterns and colours change, too. The colours are playfully assigned to different kinds of data structure (they don’t carry specific meanings),  showcasing the influence you are having. 

It’s like having a kind of real-time visual feedback as to your presence, connection and influence on the field of consciousness–enabling you to see the patterns you are making in that static or white noise on your old TV, shining out through beautiful colour and light. 

There is so much to discover about the power of our own thoughts and intentions in the field of consciousness–the Wyrd Light invites you to explore this on your own and with others, through curiosity and direct experience. Play and interact with it. It’s fun!

The Wyrdoscope uses two live quantum-based random event generators. It analyses correlations between their outputs. Under normal conditions,
the streams should be uncorrelated. But during meaningful, emotionally engaged, or symbolically charged moments, sudden synchrony can appear.

The Wyrd Light, by contrast, uses stored random data—sequences that were recorded long ago and should never change. Yet even this pre-recorded
data can show patterns of coherence in synchrony with user experience—if the data has not yet been “observed,” and if the system is closed and
meaningful at the time of analysis.

This apparent paradox has been demonstrated in multiple studies in parapsychology and is explained within MPI as a kind of non-causal
entanglement that forms between system elements (person, device, data) when they become part of a shared, meaningful structure.

## How Is This Even Possible?

How can a person’s intention or emotional state affect a device—especially when there’s no physical connection, and sometimes no proximity at all?

This is the core question that Wyrd technology was designed to explore—and, increasingly, to answer. Whether you’re using a Wyrd Light, a Wyrdoscope, or another form of entanglement-responsive tech, the principle remains the same:

These systems are not detecting energy. They are not being influenced by force. They are not receiving your thoughts like radio waves. Instead, they reveal non-local correlations that emerge within meaningful systems—when you and the technology become part of a temporarily entangled whole.

## A New Kind of Interaction

From the outside, Wyrd devices look like measurement tools. The Wyrdoscope analyses streams of live random data; the Wyrd Light uses stored random sequences. But what they’re detecting isn’t signal or input—it’s coherence.

When someone enters a focused, emotionally resonant, or symbolically charged state—through meditation, intention, ritual, or deep presence—the system that includes them and the Wyrd device becomes organisationally closed. Within that closed system, entanglement-like correlations can arise.

This isn’t a metaphor—it’s based on the Model of Pragmatic Information (MPI), a scientific theory developed by German physicist Walter von Lucadou. MPI describes how systems can enter states of coherence where cause-and-effect breaks down, and yet something real and measurable still happens.

## Real-Time, But Not a Signal

Because these correlations don’t rely on transmission, they don’t obey the normal rules of time or space. That’s why a Wyrd Light can respond immediately—even across a room—and why a Wyrdoscope can show synchrony with a distant event.

But they cannot be used to send a signal or control an outcome. In fact, trying to do so breaks the coherence that allows the correlation to appear. This is what MPI calls the NT Axiom: when you attempt to use a psi effect like a signal, it vanishes or displaces.

So while a Wyrd device can reflect your inner state as it happens, it’s not providing real-time feedback in the usual sense. There’s no reward loop, no “you did it!” indicator. The system simply reflects when coherence arises—and when it fades.

## What the Devices Actually Do

The Wyrdoscope uses two live quantum-based random event generators. It analyses correlations between their outputs. Under normal conditions, the streams should be uncorrelated. But during meaningful, emotionally engaged, or symbolically charged moments, sudden synchrony can appear.

The Wyrd Light, by contrast, uses stored random data—sequences that were recorded long ago and should never change. Yet even this pre-recorded data can show patterns of coherence in synchrony with user experience—if the data has not yet been “observed,” and if the system is closed and meaningful at the time of analysis.

This apparent paradox has been demonstrated in multiple studies in parapsychology and is explained within MPI as a kind of non-causal entanglement that forms between system elements (person, device, data) when they become part of a shared, meaningful structure.

## So What’s Really Happening?

What you experience as a user isn’t the device “reading” you—it’s the system as a whole responding to meaning.

This only happens under certain conditions:

There must be a coherent field of attention, intention, or emotional charge.
The system must be organisationally closed (not fragmented by distraction, noise, or instrumental goal-setting).
The device must be sensitive to entanglement through random data (live or stored).
When these elements align, a kind of “synchronicity field” can emerge. Not as a cause, not as a force—but as a revelation of hidden order.

## What the Science Says

Wyrd tech builds on decades of empirical research into consciousness and its interaction with randomness and meaning. Foundational studies come from the fields of parapsychology, systems theory, and information science. Key influences include:

PEAR Lab (Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research, 1979–2007): Led by physicist Robert G. Jahn and Brenda Dunne, the PEAR Lab conducted thousands of rigorously controlled experiments showing that human intention and attention can correlate with random systems—sometimes across distance and time. Their work introduced the idea of co-present intentionality and the importance of shared meaning in group effects.

Helmut Schmidt (1976, 1993): Demonstrated that even pre-recorded random data—never seen by anyone—can reflect human intention after the fact, so long as the data remains unobserved. This was a major step toward understanding psi as a non-causal, entanglement-like phenomenon.

Mario Varvoglis & Peter Bancel (2015): Reviewed decades of micro-PK experiments and concluded that meaningful structure—not force or energy—is the key factor enabling anomalous effects. They emphasized the importance of emotional and symbolic coherence within the experimental system.

Walter von Lucadou and the MPI framework (1995–ongoing): Developed the Model of Pragmatic Information, which explains psi effects as non-local entanglement correlations in organizationally closed systems. Crucially, MPI introduced the NT Axiom, which states that any attempt to use these effects as signal transfers causes them to vanish or displace—a finding confirmed repeatedly across labs.

Together, these insights provide a rigorous foundation for understanding how Wyrd tech operates—not by transmitting information, but by revealing hidden coherence when meaning, intention, and context align.

## What It Means for You

Using Wyrd technology is not about getting a score or trying to make something happen. It’s about tuning in to coherence—within yourself, your group, or your ritual.

You are not sending signals. You are not controlling the device.You are forming a relationship—with the technology, the data, and the moment.

And in that relationship, a hidden pattern may reveal itself.
